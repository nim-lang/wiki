***

Won't work in arc without changes in the libraries:
- https://gist.github.com/Yardanico/5a9f7e9842101443ebf662c58340f406#gistcomment-3289689:
  - https://github.com/brentp/hts-nim doesn't work
  - https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth doesn't work because hts-nim doesn't work

***

A bug or not yet sure:
- https://github.com/jangko/nimAES/ - a bug in the library itself, read https://irclogs.nim-lang.org/21-07-2020.html#23:28:13
- [ARC: deepCopy in new runtime feature missing, do we have alternatives?](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/13997):
  - https://github.com/PMunch/nim-persistent-vector: because of `deepCopy` [here](https://github.com/PMunch/nim-persistent-vector/blob/master/persvector.nim#L56)
  - https://github.com/NimParsers/parsetoml: uses `deepCopy` too
- https://github.com/mratsim/Arraymancer: known, [issue here](https://github.com/mratsim/Arraymancer/issues/423)
- https://github.com/Vindaar/ggplotnim: blocked by arraymancer
- nimsuggest - compiles if you put ~10 `{.nosinks.}`, but fails for the first `nimsuggest` test.
- https://github.com/PMunch/nimlsp - doesn't work as it depends on `nimsuggest`
- https://github.com/zedeus/nitter - [[ARC] Undeclared variable in C with inline pragma and iterators](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/14251) - works if you workaround this bug (by removing inline pragma from some nim-regex functions) and add a few ``{.nosinks.}`` annotations."""
